First i created a repository at GitHub. Then I worked in Git Bash. Cloned the repository using the command - **git clone**. I 

created file **readme.txt** using the command - **touch**. Then i created develop branch named **dev** using the command - **git checkout -b dev**. I added links to photos into *index.html*. Then I did the same with *styles*. At the stage **merge** I had a conflict because of file **index**. I was able to resolve the conflict by manually editing the file **index**. After that I did everything required with the commands **git log** and **git reflog**.
