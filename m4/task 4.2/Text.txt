1. Corporate network of the organization.

2 buildings with 2 floors. Each floor has 5 PCs. The assignment does not indicate anything about routers or subnetting the network, so I went the simplest way. In each building, I hung up my own switch, which are connected to each other using a Copper Cross-over cable.

Theoretically, it was possible to use 1 switch for 2 buildings, but then 10 cables would have to be pulled from one of the buildings at once, and this would create cumbersomeness.

PCs in the first building received addresses from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.10, in the second - from 192.168.0.11 to 192.168.0.20

The performance was checked using the Ping command.



2. My task was to organize 8 subnets (5 + 3 PCs in each). I managed to organize the network using 2 switches. Each of the switches contains 4 subnets. I also used a router to do the routing. I managed to achieve the ability to send packets from any PC on the network to any PC.

First, I set up a VLAN for each of the 8 subnets. 

enable
conf t
10 name WG1

The same for the rest of the VLANs.

I assigned a network interface to each of the VLANs using the commands:

interface fastethernet 0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10

I repeated the same for the remaining 7 VLANs.

I gave VLAN access to computers from the workgroup.

interface fastEthernet 0/2-5
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10

the same for other VLANs.

After that, I configured trunk ports on each of the switches by connecting them to the router.

interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40

The same is on the second switch fot VLANs 50, 60, 70, 80.

After that, on the router, I created subinterfaces for VLANs and assigned them IP addresses, which became gateways.

interface fastEt 0/0.1
encapsulation dot1Q 10
ip address 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0

I did the same for the rest of the VLANs and after that I registered dynamic routing by command

ip routing

Thus, I was able to achieve communication between all PCs in 8 subnets.
