As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, "God be with you"
If there's a God, why has he let me go?

As I walk, my life drifts before me
Though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

Yeah-yeah-yeah, hallowed be thy name
Yeah-yeah-yeah, hallowed by thy name
Yeah
